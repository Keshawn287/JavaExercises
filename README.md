# JavaExercises ☕

A curated collection of Java exercises and problem solutions gathered from my **college coursework and professional experience**.  
This repository focuses on **core Java fundamentals**, **logic-building problems**, and **common interview-style challenges** such as Palindrome checks, string manipulation, loops, and data structures.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Strengthen Java fundamentals
- Serve as a personal reference library
- Help others learning Java from beginner to early-intermediate level

## 📌 What's Inside

This repository contains:
- ✅ Beginner-friendly Java programs  
- ✅ Algorithm and logic practice problems  
- ✅ Real-world inspired coding exercises  
- ✅ Interview-style questions and solutions  

Example topics include:
- Palindrome Program
- String Reversal
- Number Problems
- Loops & Conditionals
- Arrays & Basic Data Structures

---

## 🧠 Example Exercise: Palindrome Checker

A **palindrome** is a word, phrase, number, or sequence that reads the same forward and backward (e.g., `racecar`, `121`).

In this repo, you’ll find Java solutions that:
- Reverse a string using loops
- Compare original vs reversed values
- Validate numeric palindromes
- Handle user input via terminal

## 🛠 Core Java Terminology & Concepts

### Variables - are used to store data types
- every variable must have a data type
- Must have a unique name within its scope

### Data types - Java has two main data type categories
1. Primitive Data Types
   - byte myByte = 127; --> Smallest integer type. Range: -128 to 127.
   - short myShort = 32000; --> Larger than byte, smaller than int. Range: -32,768 to 32,767.
   - int myInt = 2147000000; --> Default integer type. Range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
   - long myLong = 9223372036854775807L; --> Larger integer type for wider range. Range: -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
   - float myFloat = 3.14159f; --> Single-precision 32-bit floating point. Use 'f' suffix to denote float literal.
   - double myDouble = 3.141592653589793; --> Double-precision 64-bit floating point. Default for floating-point numbers.
   - boolean myBool = true; --> Holds either true or false
   - char myChar = 'A'; --> Single 16-bit Unicode character.
     
2. Reference Data Type
   - String
   - Arrays
   - Objects
   - Classes

### 🔹 1. Basic Java Setup

To run Java programs locally, you need:
- **JDK (Java Development Kit)**
- A **code editor or IDE** (VS Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse)
- Proper **environment variables** (`JAVA_HOME`)

Compile and run from terminal:
```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
